These small additions can transform your property into a sought-after destination for multi-generational travelers.*\n\n## Introduction: Why Families Are Profitable Guests\nFamilies represent a highly profitable segment for short-term rental hosts. They typically stay longer, book less impulsively, and are willing to pay a premium for comfort and convenience. By implementing simple family-friendly upgrades, you can position your property as the top choice in your area, directly impacting your bottom line.\n\n## Amenity 1: Portable Crib - The Essential Investment\nA quality portable crib is arguably the most valuable amenity you can offer families. This simple investment dramatically increases your property's appeal to parents traveling with young children. Without this essential item, you may miss out on a substantial portion of your potential guest base.\n\n## Amenity 2: High Chair Solution - Beyond Basic Needs\nMeal times can be stressful for traveling families without proper equipment. A durable, easy-to-clean high chair solves this common pain point. Even a basic model can significantly enhance your listing's appeal and justify a higher nightly rate.\n\n## Amenity 3: Thoughtful Toy Collection\nA curated selection of sanitized toys and books provides entertainment during downtime. This amenity is particularly valuable during inclement weather or when parents need quiet moments. Make sure to clearly communicate your sanitization protocols to build trust with families.\n\n## Amenity 4: Safety First with Outlet Covers\nPeace of mind is crucial for families with young children. Installing outlet covers demonstrates your commitment to safety and can be the deciding factor for hesitant parents. This simple touch shows you've considered all aspects of their stay.\n\n## Amenity 5: Blackout Curtains - Creating Family Sanctuaries\nQuality blackout curtains aren't just for darkening a room - they're essential for families with infants and young children. These curtains enable proper sleep schedules, which parents greatly appreciate. Consider professional installation for optimal blackout performance.\n\n## Putting It Into Action\nAfter implementing these family-friendly upgrades, strategically highlight them in your listing photos and descriptions. Be specific about the amenities you offer - families appreciate transparency. These affordable additions can transform your rental into a family destination, allowing you to capture a valuable and loyal segment of the market.\n\n- Invest in a quality portable crib as the most impactful family amenity\n- Provide a durable high chair to enhance mealtime experiences\n- Curate a collection of sanitized toys and books for entertainment\n- Install outlet covers to demonstrate safety commitment\n- Upgrade to blackout curtains for better sleep and rest\n\nThese simple additions won't cost you much but will significantly increase your rental's appeal to families, potentially adding $20 or more to your nightly rate.","frontmatter":{"title":"5 'Family-Friendly' Items That Let You Charge $20 More Per Night","date":null,"description":"Discover five affordable amenities that can attract family guests and boost your rental income by $20 per night.","cover":"/images/blogs/5-family-friendly-items-to-charge-more/hero.jpg","coverAlt":"A family enjoying a cozy rental with family-friendly amenities.","tags":["Family Travel","Hosting Tips","Home Improvement"],"category":"Guest Experience"}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/7-deadly-mistakes-that-make-99-of-new-hosts-fail/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"7 Deadly Mistakes That Make 99% of New Hosts Fail in Their First 3 Months in India & SEA"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/5-day-1-setup-mistakes-that-will-cost-you-your-first-5-star-review/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"5 'Day 1' Setup Mistakes That Will Cost You Your First 5-Star Review"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"e1d0fb97-9ce9-5a59-9ec0-dd1d5bf0a706","previousPostId":"8f87934b-c59a-54a1-8d49-f4cf953aef2c","nextPostId":"abd1b2bc-c132-5079-9b49-d0964df01874","frontmatter":{"title":"5 'Family-Friendly' Items That Let You Charge $20 More Per Night","description":"Discover five affordable amenities that can attract family guests and boost your rental income by $20 per night.","slug":"5-family-friendly-items-to-charge-more","datePublished":"2025-12-11T00:00:00.000Z","dateModified":"2025-12-11T00:00:00.000Z","excerpt":"Learn how adding five simple amenities like a portable crib and blackout curtains can make your rental more appealing to families, increasing your earnings.","category":"Guest Experience","keywords":["family-friendly","rental amenities","guest experience","portable crib"],"wordCount":1020,"readingTime":"5 mins","ogTitle":"5 'Family-Friendly' Items That Let You Charge $20 More Per Night","ogDescription":"Discover five affordable amenities that can attract family guests and boost your rental income by $20 per night.","ogImage":"/images/blogs/5-family-friendly-items-to-charge-more/hero.jpg","twitterCard":"summary_large_image","twitterSite":"@hosthustle","twitterCreator":"@hosthustle","language":"en-US","series":"","part":0,"related":[],"noindex":false,"priority":0,"toc":true,"published":true,"featured":false,"tags":["Family Travel","Hosting Tips","Home Improvement"],"cover":"/images/blogs/5-family-friendly-items-to-charge-more/hero.jpg","coverAlt":"A family enjoying a cozy rental with family-friendly amenities.","coverCaption":""}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"],"slicesMap":{}}
