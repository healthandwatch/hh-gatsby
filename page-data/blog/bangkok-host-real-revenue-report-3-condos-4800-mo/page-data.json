Let's break down the costs and profitability of managing three condos, revealing insights and practical tips to maximize earnings.*\n\n## Introduction: Stop Believing the 'Passive Income' Gurus\n\nThe stunning photos of high-rise pools in Bangkok often paint a picture of effortless passive income. But let's be real: the reality includes hefty fees, unexpected expenses, and hard work. As a host managing three condos in the Sukhumvit/On Nut area, I've decided to share my actual revenue report for transparency.\n\n## My Portfolio & Gross Revenue Breakdown\n\nI manage three distinct units across two platforms:\n\n1.  **Unit 1 (Studio):** Achieves an 80% occupancy rate primarily through Agoda, targeting local Thai and Southeast Asian guests.\n2.  **Unit 2 (1-Bedroom):** Maintains 70% occupancy on Airbnb, mainly attracting Western travelers.\n3.  **Unit 3 (1-Bedroom):** Secures a 60% occupancy rate through direct bookings and extended-stay guests.\n\nCombined, these three properties generate approximately $4,800 in gross monthly revenue.\n\n## The 'Hidden Costs' That Impact Your Bottom Line\n\nWhile gross revenue looks promising, the true profit requires accounting for several significant costs:\n\n*   **Agent Commissions (30%):** Particularly relevant if utilizing rental arbitrage strategies.\n*   **Juristic Fees (15%):** Thailand's regulatory requirements for rental properties take a substantial percentage.\n*   **Electricity Costs (10%):** Air conditioning is essential in Bangkok's climate, making this a major expense.\n*   **Cleaning & Supplies (10%):** Regular housekeeping and replenishing essentials are non-negotiable.\n*   **Maintenance & Repairs (5%):** Unexpected fixes and preventative upkeep eat into profits.\n\n## The Reality Check: My Actual Net Profit\n\nAfter accounting for these essential expenses, the net profit from my three condos is significantly lower than the gross revenue suggests. This number provides a more accurate picture of what you can realistically expect. Whether this level of profit justifies the effort is ultimately a personal financial calculation.\n\n## Maximizing Profitability in Bangkok\n\nBased on my experience, here's a key strategy:\n\n**Focus on direct bookings and strategic platform usage.** While platforms like Airbnb and Agoda bring visibility, their commissions can be substantial. Direct bookings often provide better rates, and Agoda can be particularly effective for the local market. Diversifying your booking channels is crucial for sustainable profitability in Bangkok's competitive rental market.\n\n### Key Takeaways\n\n*   **Realistic Expectations:** $4,800 gross isn't equivalent to that much net profit after accounting for significant costs.\n*   **Platform Choice Matters:** Direct bookings and carefully selected platforms like Agoda can help reduce fees.\n*   **Major Expenses:** Electricity, commissions, and regulatory fees are substantial costs in Bangkok.\n*   **Transparency is Key:** Understanding all income and expenses is essential for true profitability.","frontmatter":{"title":"A Bangkok Host's Real Revenue Report: 3 Condos, $4,800/mo.
